Getting Started with Create React App
This project was bootstrapped using Create React App.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start
* Runs the app in development mode.
* Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
* The page will reload automatically upon edits.
* Lint errors will appear in the console.

npm test
* Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.

npm run build
* Builds the app for production in the build folder.
* Bundles React in production mode for optimal performance.
* The build is minified, and filenames include hashes for caching.
* Your app is ready for deployment.
* For deployment details, refer to the deployment guide.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you cannot go back.
* Copies configuration files and dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) into your project, giving you full control over them.
* All commands except eject will continue to work but will reference the copied scripts.
* Use this only if you need extensive customization beyond the curated feature set.
